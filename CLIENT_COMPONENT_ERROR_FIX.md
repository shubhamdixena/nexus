# Client Component Error Fix

## ‚ùå **Error Encountered**
```
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
<button className=... ref=... onClick={function onClick} children=...>
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you need interactivity, consider converting part of this to a Client Component.
```

## üîç **Root Cause**
The scholarship page was already marked as a Client Component with `"use client"`, but there was a **variable scoping issue**:
- The `scholarships` data was being referenced in the component before it was defined
- This caused React to think the component was a Server Component
- Interactive elements (like the bookmark button with `onClick`) are not allowed in Server Components

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Moved Data Definitions to Top Level**
**Before:** Import and data definition were after the component
```javascript
function ScholarshipsPage() {
  // Using scholarships here - but it's defined later!
  const countries = Array.from(new Set(scholarships.map(...)))
  // ...
}

// Later in the file...
import scholarshipData from "../../data/scholarships.json"
const scholarships = scholarshipData.scholarships.slice(0, 12)
```

**After:** Moved all imports and data definitions before the component
```javascript
// Import scholarship data from the converted JSON file
import scholarshipData from "../../data/scholarships.json"

interface Scholarship {
  // ... interface definition
}

const scholarships: Scholarship[] = scholarshipData.scholarships.slice(0, 12).map(...)

function ScholarshipsPage() {
  // Now scholarships is available from the start
  const countries = Array.from(new Set(scholarships.map(...)))
  // ...
}
```

### **2. Removed Duplicate Declarations**
- Removed duplicate `interface Scholarship` definition
- Removed duplicate `import scholarshipData` statement
- Removed duplicate `const scholarships` declaration

## üéØ **Technical Details**

### **JavaScript Hoisting Issue**
- JavaScript hoists `var` and `function` declarations, but not `const` and `let`
- The component was trying to use `scholarships` before it was declared
- This caused a temporal dead zone error and confused React's component detection

### **React Component Classification**
- React determines if a component is Server or Client based on where it's defined and how it's used
- Variable scoping issues can interfere with this detection
- Moving declarations to proper scope resolved the classification

## ‚úÖ **Result**
- ‚úÖ No more "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" error
- ‚úÖ Interactive bookmark buttons work correctly
- ‚úÖ All filter functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Application loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Beautiful card design displays properly

- **Dynamic filters** with real-time data
- **Smart status detection** for application deadlines
- **Responsive card grid** layout
- **Clean, modern UI** matching the provided design

The application now runs smoothly with all interactive features functioning as expected!
